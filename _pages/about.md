Chunmei Qing, Doctor, Associate Professor, Master's Supervisor, and a Young Innovative Talent in Ordinary Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province. Since 2013, I have been an associate professor in the School of Electronic and Information Engineering at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/), Guangzhou, China. In recent years, I have focused on conducting research in cutting-edge interdisciplinary areas and major regional industrial needs, particularly in virtual reality technology, multimodal affective computing, and natural human-computer interaction. I have undertaken a total of 8 projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation and major scientific and technological projects in Guangdong Province, and have participated in 8 projects under the key research and development plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology, major scientific and technological projects in Guangdong Province, and significant livelihood technology projects in Guangzhou.

I have published over 60 papers in related fields, including important international journals and conferences such as IEEE TAF, IEEE TMM, IEEE TCSVT, AAAI, and CVPR, with more than 3,000 citations. I have 1 ESI highly cited hot paper (top 0.1% in SCI) and 2 highly cited papers. I have been granted over ten authorized invention patents and have applied for more than 30 invention patents. I serve as a reviewer for several journals and conferences, including IEEE TMM, TIP, CSVT, and CVPR. I received the Best Poster Presentation Award at BICS 2023, the Best Student Paper Award at ICCSS 2017, and a Best Paper Nomination at ICIP 2017.

My research interest includes affective computing, virtual reality, human-computer interaction and computer vision. I have published more than 60 papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=soX8e10AAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>4700+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=soX8e10AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=soX8e10AAAAJ&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
